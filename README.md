## Hi!

I have made the PairPusher repos private.

I had put so much time and effort into crafting something that had a good deal of innovation.  But what I ran into was: some shoulder shrugging (people content to do things the same way as 2015, blue dialogs forever), or those who really "got it" and liked it.

There also did not seem to be any developer groups where I could simply talk about the project.  The moderators are gatekeepers, and they dont seem interested in new ideas.  No matter that I was doing this as a Free, Open Source project.  I was trying to give a gift to the AVsitter community - some little bit of innovation to work with, but I could not even talk to them.

It is too frustrating, and so I am shelving the project on MP, and here on Github.

The LICENSE and Trademarks still apply, by the way :)

At least I learned a lot about doing a large, non-trivial project, end to end, as a collab with AI.
