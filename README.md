## Hi!

I have made the PairPusher repos private.

I had put so much time and effort into crafting something that had a good deal of innovation.  But what I ran into was a lot of shoulder shrugging (people content to do things the same way as 2015, blue dialogs forever).

There also did not seem to be any developer groups where I could simply talk about the project.  The moderators are gatekeepers, and they dont seem interested in new ideas.  No matter that I was doing this as a Free, Open Source project.

It is too frustrating, and so I am shelving the project on MP, and here on Github.

The LICENSE and Trademarks still apply, by the way :)
